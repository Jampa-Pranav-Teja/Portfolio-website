        Student | Aspiring Software Engineer | Full Stack Developer in Progress | Hackathon Enthusiast | Passionate about Innovation & Impact<br><br>

        Despite not securing a seat in the IITs, my passion for programming never wavered. I joined KL University with a clear goal: to achieve the highest placement package by setting myself apart.<br><br>
        
        In my first semester, I focused deeply on academics and secured a perfect 10 CGPA. But I quickly realized that academic excellence alone wouldn’t be enough — to truly stand out, I needed to take initiative and build something meaningful with a team.<br><br>
        
        That’s when I launched Project Phoenix — a team of six passionate students united by one goal: to become the best tech team in the university. After researching industry trends, I discovered that Full Stack Development was the perfect starting point — practical, in-demand, and fun. We’ve completed HTML and CSS, and we’re on track to finish the full stack course in the next 3 months.<br><br>
        
        Alongside this, I actively practice problem-solving on CodeChef, and I’ve also learned Python and C programming, which have strengthened my foundation in logic and software development.<br><br>
        
        Our team was recently selected in an ideathon on campus for our idea on Urban Waste Management using IoT, and we had the opportunity to present our project at Hack for SDG hosted at IIT Hyderabad. I’ve also participated in two hackathons at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, where I showcased my skills, collaborated with diverse teams, and gained exposure to real-world problem-solving.<br><br>
        
        This journey isn’t just about learning tech — it’s about building, collaborating, and constantly pushing boundaries. I’m always open to connecting with like-minded individuals, mentors, and organizations who believe in innovation, impact, and growth.
